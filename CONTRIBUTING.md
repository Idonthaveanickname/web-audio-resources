# Contributing to web audio resources

Thanks for your interest in this project! Here are a few pointers for contributions:

If you wish to submit a resource to this list:

- Make sure the resource (still) works with the latest versions of the main browsers. Due to the rapidly evolving state of the web audio API, I've seen projects that use deprecated APIs that lose support and thus crash in more recent browsers.
- If you are unsure as to which category to use for your resource, [feel free to ask](https://github.com/alemangui/web-audio-resources/issues). Or you can also just send the pull request and I'll try to sort it out. 

If you wish to remove a resource from the list, please state the reason of the removal in your pull request, for example: 
  - The resource is not longer available.
  - The resource used deprecated APIs that are no longer working (in which case some details about the errors you encountered would be helpful).
  - The resource has moved to a different URL.
